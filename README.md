Dumbell charts for the EPL 2018/2019 season so far

As we’ve hit the November international break in the 2018/19 season, I decided it would be a good opportunity to apply the previous dumbbell charts to this season’s EPL data. As before data came from www.football-data.co.uk and visualisation were created in R using ggplot2 and ggalt. The first dumbbell chart sorted the teams in their final league positions. 

First impressions are how different this looks to the nicely arranged end of 2017/18 season chart. There are some very tight win odds (Man City and Everton) as well as some widely varying odds (Cardiff, Wolves, Burnley and Huddersfield). The standout performances come from Bournemouth and Watford who are both higher in the table than their odds suggest. Also Brighton would probably be in the bottom three if minimum odds were to be believed.  
The teams were again reordered per the minimum average odds with actual finishing positions shown in brackets.

The top 5 teams are in the correct order, the bookies have got this right! The performance of Bournemouth and Watford then throws the mid-division teams out a little but most are there or there abouts until we look at Southamton who are not performing as well as the bookies have predicted. Nor have Fulham who find themselves rock bottom. At the bottom of the chart we can see that the Bookies would have Brighton in the bottom three but have exceeded expectations.
